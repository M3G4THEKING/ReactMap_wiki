# Nginx
This is a basic setup to get ReactMap running with Nginx. It is highly recommended you enable SSL (https) for production systems for both security and "locate me" feature. That is beyond the scope of this documentation and there are many ways to solve this.

## Linux Setup
- `sudo apt-get update`
- `sudo apt-get install nginx`
- `sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
- Copy and paste the below into the file

```nginx
server {
    listen        80;
    listen        [::]:80;
    server_name   your_map_url.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass              http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
        proxy_set_header        Host $host;
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
        proxy_buffering         off;
        proxy_set_header        Connection keep-alive;
    }
}
```

## Docker Setup
- Uncomment the nginx section in the `docker-compose.example.yml` file
- Create your config file - `touch server/src/configs/nginx.conf`
- Copy and paste the below into the file

```nginx config
server {
    listen        80;
    listen        [::]:80;
    server_name   your_map_url.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass              http://reactmap:8080/;
        proxy_set_header        Host $host;
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
        proxy_buffering         off;
        proxy_set_header        Connection keep-alive;
    }
}
```

# Setup CertBot

-`sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache`

-`To check this up, open the virtual host file for your domain using nano or your preferred text editor:`

`sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your_domain.conf`
`Find the existing ServerName and ServerAlias lines. They should look like this:`

`/etc/apache2/sites-available/your_domain.conf`
`...`
`ServerName your_domain`
`ServerAlias www.your_domain`
`...`
`If you already have your ServerName and ServerAlias set up like this, `
`you can exit your text editor and move on to the next step. `
`If you’re using nano, you can exit by typing CTRL+X, then Y and ENTER to confirm.`

-`sudo apache2ctl configtest`

-`sudo systemctl reload apache2`

-`Allowing HTTPS Through the Firewall`

-`To verify what kind of traffic is currently allowed on your server, you can use:`

-`sudo ufw status`
-`If you have followed one of our Apache installation guides, your output should look something like this, meaning that only HTTP traffic on port 80 is currently allowed:`

-`Output`
-`Status: active`

The next step will prompt you to inform Certbot of which domains you’d like to activate HTTPS for. The listed domain names are automatically obtained from your Apache virtual host configuration, that’s why it’s important to make sure you have the correct ServerName and ServerAlias settings configured in your virtual host. If you’d like to enable HTTPS for all listed domain names (recommended), you can leave the prompt blank and hit ENTER to proceed. Otherwise, select the domains you want to enable HTTPS for by listing each appropriate number, separated by commas and/ or spaces, then hit ENTER.

Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1: your_domain
2: www.your_domain

Select the appropriate numbers separated by commas and/or spaces, or leave input
blank to select all options shown (Enter 'c' to cancel): 
You’ll see output like this:

Next, you’ll be prompted to select whether or not you want HTTP traffic redirected to HTTPS. In practice, that means when someone visits your website through unencrypted channels (HTTP), they will be automatically redirected to the HTTPS address of your website. Choose 2 to enable the redirection, or 1 if you want to keep both HTTP and HTTPS as separate methods of accessing your website.

Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.

1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
change by editing your web server's configuration.

After this step, Certbot’s configuration is finished, and you will be presented with the final remarks about your new certificate, where to locate the generated files, and how to test your configuration using an external tool that analyzes your certificate’s authenticity:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Congratulations! You have successfully enabled https://your_domain and
https://www.your_domain

You should test your configuration at:
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=your_domain
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.your_domain
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2020-07-27. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le

Your certificate is now installed and loaded into Apache’s configuration. Try reloading your website using https:// and notice your browser’s security indicator. It should point out that your site is properly secured, typically by including a lock icon in the address bar.

You can use the SSL Labs Server Test to verify your certificate’s grade and obtain detailed information about it, from the perspective of an external service.

In the next and final step, we’ll test the auto-renewal feature of Certbot, which guarantees that your certificate will be renewed automatically before the expiration date.

Step 5 — Verifying Certbot Auto-Renewal
Let’s Encrypt’s certificates are only valid for ninety days. This is to encourage users to automate their certificate renewal process, as well as to ensure that misused certificates or stolen keys will expire sooner rather than later.

The certbot package we installed takes care of renewals by including a renew script to /etc/cron.d, which is managed by a systemctl service called certbot.timer. This script runs twice a day and will automatically renew any certificate that’s within thirty days of expiration.

To check the status of this service and make sure it’s active and running, you can use:

sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
You’ll get output similar to this:

Output
● certbot.timer - Run certbot twice daily
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/certbot.timer; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (waiting) since Tue 2020-04-28 17:57:48 UTC; 17h ago
    Trigger: Wed 2020-04-29 23:50:31 UTC; 12h left
   Triggers: ● certbot.service

August 09 20:30:48 fine-turtle systemd[1]: Started Run certbot twice daily.
To test the renewal process, you can do a dry run with certbot:

sudo certbot renew --dry-run
