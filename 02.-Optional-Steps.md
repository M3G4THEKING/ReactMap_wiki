## Additional Config Setup
- There are additional configs options available in `server/src/configs/default.json` that can be utilized by copying them over into your config file. Be sure to maintain the same object structure when copying options over.
- Full explanation of all of the config options can be found [here](https://github.com/WatWowMap/ReactMap/wiki/4.-Full-Config-Explanation)

## Areas.json file
- You can add a `server/src/configs/areas.json` file that's in GeoJSON format (see `areas.example.json` for the format) for your users to be able to visualize your currently scanned areas.
- If you're coming from Poracle and aren't using a GeoJSON format, you can place your `geofence.json` file into the `server/src/configs` folder and then convert the file into a GeoJSON format using `yarn create-area`.

## Using the .env File
- From the root of the directory `cp example.env .env`
- `nano .env`
- If you want to use Google Analytics, you can add your GA Universal ID here. 
- If you want to use debug mode, add "ANALYTICS_DEBUG_MODE=true" to your `.env`. Only use debug mode during development.
- You can also set a title for the map if you want it to load it up a bit faster compared to the default Map title.

## Changing the Favicon
Place your favicon in the `public/favicon/` folder, it must be named `favicon.ico`. Do not replace the `fallback.ico` image, this will cause Git issues if the default favicon is ever changed. In order for changes to take place, you must recompile and restart the server. In some cases, the old favicon may be cached by Nginx or Cloudflare, you'll need to reset those caches if so.

## Scanning Nests
- If you want to scan nests, setup [NestWatcher](https://github.com/M4d40/nestwatcher)
- Be sure to run the SQL migrations provided

## Scanning Portals
- If you want to scan portals, setup [IntelWatcher](https://github.com/SenorKarlos/intelwatcher)
- Be sure to run the SQL migrations provided

## Utility Scripts
- `yarn build` - manually recompile a new client
- `yarn server` - only runs ReactMap's web server
- `yarn generate` - generates a new masterfile
- `yarn create-locales` - generates new locale files
- `yarn create-area` - converts a Poracle geofence into a Geojson file
- `yarn migrate:latest` - runs all of the migrations
- `yarn migrate:rollback` - rolls back a migration, run twice to reset all of the migrations
