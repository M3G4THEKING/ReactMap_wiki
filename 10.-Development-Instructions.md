1. Follow steps 1-6 on the Standard Setup Page
2. Open two consoles
3. `yarn dev` in one, starts the server with nodemon
4. `yarn watch` in the other, this automatically re-compiles your bundle for faster development.

**The dev yarn scripts do not generate the masterfile and locales like the production scripts do, you must generate them manually using these:**

- `yarn generate` if you want to experiment with the masterfile generator
- `yarn create-locales` if you want to generate locales manually
- `yarn missing-locales` generates JSONs that have a list of the missing keys for each locale
- `yarn build` to only build and not run the server
- `yarn server` to only start the server without recompiling webpack
- `yarn console` repl server for running code/playing with the ORM
- `yarn migrate:make addNewFeature` to generate a new migration file called 'addNewFeature'
