Golbat is a new data processor. It is new, exciting, and super fast. Since there is a ton of interest from the community and currently Golbat is the only system that supports many of the latest game features, Golbat get it's own page.

So what do you actually need to do.
1. Go setup [Golbat Setup](https://unownhash.com/docs). 
2. Pay attention to the [Hybrid Setup](https://unownhash.com/docs/other/hybrid-setup) as many RealDeviceMap users will need this guide.
3. Update ReactMap.

    _Routes are currently only available in the `develop` branch as of Aug. 3, 2023_

4. Modify your configuration file (`server/src/configs/local.json`).


### Configuration
This will use Golbat for everything. Spawns, Quests, Pokemon (InMemory using the API endpoint), etc. Please read and understand the notes in the [Hybrid Setup](https://unownhash.com/docs/other/hybrid-setup) guide.
