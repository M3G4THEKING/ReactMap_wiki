React Map also includes an interface to interact with webhooks. Currently, it only supports [Poracle](https://github.com/KartulUdus/PoracleJS) but may support more in the future.

You can add an unlimited numbers of webhooks into the webhook array.
```js
"webhooks": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      // Set the Webhook provider
      "provider": "poracle",
      // The custom name of your webhook
      "name": "My Poracle Bot",
      // Host address of your webhook
      "host": "http://0.0.0.0",
      // Host port of your webhook
      "port": 8081,
      // Secret to connect to your webhook's API
      "poracleSecret": "Your Poracle Secret",
      // Address format for nomintim search results to display to your users
      "addressFormat": "{{streetNumber}} {{streetName}}, \n {{city}} {{state}} {{zipcode}}",
      // Areas you do not want to be displayed on the map 
      // (good for large coverage areas that overlap smaller areas)
      "areasToSkip": [
        "newyork",
        "downtown"
      ],
      // Discord roles that are allowed to use this webhook.
      "discordRoles": [],
      // Telegram Groups that are allowed to use this webhook
      "telegramGroups": []
    }
]
```

- This functionality is all API based, it does not directly interact with your Webhook database
- You can add any number of webhooks to the array, they should have unique names!
- Some Poracle settings are grabbed at server initialization, so if you change something Poracle side and need ReactMap to grab the latest, restart the server/PM2 - no need to rebuild.
- Permissions must be refreshed if you make changes to the `discordRoles` array, change the session secret in your config to force your users to logout and get the latest permissions.
